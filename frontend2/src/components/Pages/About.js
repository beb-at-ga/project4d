        Ahhh, the joy of knowing that your marketing lead lists are clean,
        compliant, and targeted to those who might be receptive to your message.

      <h3>Do Not Solicite Laws</h3>
      <p>
        The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications
        Commission (FCC) require most marketers to scrub their telephone lead
        lists against the National Do Not Call Registry at least once every 31
        days. <b><em>Fines of up to $42,530 per incident</em></b> may be issued for
        non-compliance. You must also maintain and honor a corporate "do not
        call" list. There are currently 12 states that maintain their own do not
        call lists that need to be scrubbed against as well: CO, FL, LA, IN, MA,
        MI, MO, OK, PA, TN, TX, WY.

        Marketers should take special care when calling wireless numbers (both
        those that have been ported from landlines and those with the first
        seven digits that match designated wireless phone exchanges). There are
        strict consent requirements for calling wireless numbers. â€‹

        For email campaigns, the CAN-SPAM Act requires those sending commercial
        emails to honor "do not email" requests within 10 business days.
        Penalties of up to $42,530 per email sent in violation of this act may
        be assessed.
